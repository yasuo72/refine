## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#7196](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/7196) [`9217c8596b368bca668dbea9493c0076c57f1d31`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/9217c8596b368bca668dbea9493c0076c57f1d31) Thanks [@erenkurnaz](https://github.com/erenkurnaz)! - fix(rest): make `getMany` method optional in data provider

  The `getMany` method is no longer provided by default. Previously, a default implementation was included, but it has been removed to make the method truly optional. Users who need the `getMany` functionality must now explicitly define it in their data provider configuration.

## 2.0.3

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#7049](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/7049) [`f36f0a6cca47013365d32c261416e8558d41b265`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/f36f0a6cca47013365d32c261416e8558d41b265) Thanks [@alicanerdurmaz](https://github.com/alicanerdurmaz)! - fix: `getMany` method now returns the complete response body

  Previously, `getMany` method was returning `body.records` which assumed a specific response structure. Now it returns the complete response body directly, providing more flexibility for different API response formats.

### Patch Changes

- [#7047](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/pull/7047) [`f1085a350344fb5264099fc46123a8b05944154b`](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/commit/f1085a350344fb5264099fc46123a8b05944154b) Thanks [@alicanerdurmaz](https://github.com/alicanerdurmaz)! - fix: `getMany` `mapResponse` return value is wrong.

  Now `getMany` properly handles both array and object response formats by checking if the response is an array and returning the appropriate data structure.
