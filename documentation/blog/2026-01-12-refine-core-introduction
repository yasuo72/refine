We have an important update to share with our community.

## What's Changing

2025 has been a transformative year for our team. We've grown significantly and learned valuable lessons about how to best serve our users. Today, we're announcing that we're splitting Refine into two products, each with its own brand and focus:

**Refine** is now our AI-powered internal application builder, taking the main stage at refine.dev

**Refine Core** will be our open source framework, available at refine.dev/core


## Why We're Making This Change

When we first started Refine, we built it to solve a problem we encountered repeatedly: doing the same things over and over while building web applications. The framework grew into a powerful tool that thousands of developers rely on.

Last year, we decided to create an AI tool that leverages Refine Core's architecture to generate complete applications. Building an AI tool while maintaining and evolving a large open source project like Refine Core has been challenging. However, the response from our community has been overwhelming. Your feedback has helped us grow the AI tool to a point where it deserves its own identity and spotlight.

Our current website structure wasn't clearly communicating the distinct value of each product. By separating them with their own brands, we can better serve both audiences: Refine Core for developers who want a robust framework and Refine for teams who want to leverage that framework for AI-powered application generation.

## What This Means for You

### If you're using our open source framework:
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Your projects will continue to work exactly as they do today
- Documentation, support, and community resources will be maintained at refine.dev/core
- We remain committed to supporting and maintaining Refine Core

### If you're interested in our AI tool:
- Visit refine.dev to explore the newly branded Refine
- Experience AI-powered application generation built on proven architecture
- Get started faster with intelligent code generation and assistance

## Our Commitment

We want to be transparent: while Refine Core will continue to receive full support and maintenance, our primary development focus will shift toward the AI tool. We believe this approach allows us to innovate rapidly on the AI front while ensuring stability and reliability for our open source users.

Both products will thrive in their own right, and this separation allows us to give each the attention it deserves.

## What's Next

* **Existing users:** No action is required. Your current setup will continue working seamlessly.

* **Documentation:** We're updating all documentation to reflect the new structure. Bookmark refine.dev/core for framework resources.

* **Questions?** We're here to help. Reach out through info@refine.dev, and we'll be happy to answer any questions about this transition.

Thank you for being part of our journey. We're excited about what's ahead for both Refine Core and Refine, and we're grateful for your continued support.
